I know, I am one of them. Late August the Legion expansion was launched, and we all held our breath.\r\n\r\nI spent 3 days playing a game, and it was the best technology experience I have ever had. I will discuss the history of past releases, the user experience and how it was communicated to us. We will learn a bit about the technology and solutions behind the problems that had plagued them in the past. The promises given, the expectations and the results.\r\n\r\nWorking in IT I saw a lot of correlations in this experience to releasing software. Come to this session and learn how you can bring users around and the expected results when you do."
