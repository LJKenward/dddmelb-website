We welcome sessions from any dev related topic. Previously we have had a wide range of sessions from agile to C++ to JavaScript to Haskell. If voters think your session is relevant or interesting it's in!

Before submitting a session please consider the following:

- Sessions are not a sales presentation although you are welcome to have a slide or two about yourself and your company
- You will probably not have internet access
- We will open voting about a month prior to the event. If your session gets voted in and you agree to present, then this is a serious commitment
- Experienced presenter, Author & MVP Guy Smith Ferrier has some great advice on [how to give a great presentation](http://guysmithferrier.com/Downloads/HowToGiveGreatPresentations.pdf)

To submit a session please enter the following details (and please don't enter any HTML otherwise you will get an error after submission & you'll have to do it again):
